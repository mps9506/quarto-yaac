# Quarto-yaac Format

This is a mostly LaTeX template right now. If you want to use just
markdown, this isn't the template to use. I'm trying to work on some lua
filters that might facilitate this template in a more language agnostic
way. Pull requests welcome!

The [YAAC: Another Awesome CV](https://github.com/darwiin/yaac-another-awesome-cv) template is licensed under LaTeX Project Public License v1.3c (LPPL).

## Installing

```bash
quarto use template mps9506/quarto-yaac
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting place for your article.

## Using

*TODO*: Describe how to use your format.

## Format Options

*TODO*: If your format has options that can be set via document metadata, describe them.

## Example

Here is the source code for a minimal sample document: [example.qmd](example.qmd).
